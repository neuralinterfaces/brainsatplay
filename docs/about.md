## A Brief History of Brains@Play
### 2020: The Brains@Play Initiative
The Brains@Play Initiative was founded as a transdisciplinary research project at the University of Southern California. 

The initiative was supported by faculty advisors including: 
- [Marientina Gotsis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marientina-gotsis-24041a5/): Founder and Director of the USC Games For Health Initiative
- [Dong Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-song-159aa221/): Director of the USC Neural Modeling and Interface Laboratory
- [Dimitris Grammenos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgrammenos/): Principal Researcher at ICS-FORTH

Together, we ran an [international design fiction competition](/projects/initiative/brains-and-games-competition.md), hosted a [virtual event](/projects/initiative/livewire.md) on the ethical and social implications of emerging neurotechnology, and even led a [high school course](/projects/initiative/brains-at-play-course.md) on brain-computer interfaces.

### 2021: Brains@Play LLC

Organized at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brains@Play LLC was organized by Garrett Flynn and Joshua Brewster to develop low-cost biosensing hardware and browser-based BCI applications.We built a considerable amount of open-source software, particularly the [Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com).

Along the way, we made a few mistakes, including:
1. **Coupling our software roadmap to hardware** development goals that were too ambitious
2. **Abandoning our core product** to focus on developer tools
3. **Failing to secure sustainable funding** through contracts, grants, or community support.

Following disputes between the founders about proper professional conduct and a lack of alignment on future business decisions, **Brains@Play LLC was dissolved in late 2023.** 

The GitHub organization for the company was archived to maintain a [record of prior work](https://github.com/brainsatplay).

### 2024: Brains@Play  
Brains@Play is currently being revitalized by Garrett Flynn as a public project that collects free and open-source educational material on the design and development of brain-responsive applications.
