# Meet the Team
Our mission is to make brain-responsive applications accessible to everyone, regardless of their background in neuroscience or software engineering.

### Garrett Flynn
*Founder and Director of Brains@Play*

Garrett is a software engineer with a passion for building brain-responsive applications. With a background in neuroscience and interactive media, he has specialized in the development of browser-based BCI applications since 2019.

## A Brief History
### The Brains@Play Initiative (2020 - 2021)
The Brains@Play Initiative was founded as a transdisciplinary research project at the University of Southern California. 

The initiative was supported by faculty advisors including: 
- [Marientina Gotsis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marientina-gotsis-24041a5/): Founder and Director of the USC Games For Health Initiative
- [Dong Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-song-159aa221/): Director of the USC Neural Modeling and Interface Laboratory
- [Dimitris Grammenos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgrammenos/): Principal Researcher at ICS-FORTH

Together, we ran an [international design fiction competition](/projects/initiative/brains-and-games-competition.md), hosted a [virtual event](/projects/initiative/livewire.md) on the ethical and social implications of emerging neurotechnology, and even led a [high school course](/projects/initiative/brains-at-play-course.md) on brain-computer interfaces.

### Brains@Play LLC (2021 - 2023)
Organized at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brains@Play LLC was organized by Garrett Flynn and Joshua Brewster to develop low-cost biosensing hardware and browser-based BCI applications.

Though we built a considerable amount of open-source software—including the original [Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com)—along the way, we did not secure sustainable funding and the company was dissolved in late 2023.

A complete record of the company's output can be found on the [archived GitHub organization](https://github.com/brainsatplay).


### Brains@Play (2024 - Present)
Since mid-2024, Brains@Play has been revitalized as a personal initiative of Garrett Flynn to release free and open-source educational material on the design and development of brain-responsive applications.
