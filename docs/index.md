**The Brains@Play Initiative** was originally founded as a transdisciplinary research project at the University of Southern California.

The initiative was coordinated by [Garrett Flynn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettmflynn/) with support from faculty advisors, including:
- [Marientina Gotsis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marientina-gotsis-24041a5/): Founder and Director of the USC Games For Health Initiative
- [Dong Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-song-159aa221/): Director of the USC Neural Modeling and Interface Laboratory
- [Dimitris Grammenos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgrammenos/): Principal Researcher at ICS-FORTH

Together, we ran an [international design fiction competition](/projects/initiative/brains-and-games-competition.md), hosted a [virtual event](/projects/initiative/livewire.md) on the ethical and social implications of emerging neurotechnology, and even led a [high school course](/projects/initiative/brains-at-play-course.md) on brain-computer interfaces.

**Brains@Play LLC** was organized by Garrett Flynn and Joshua Brewster at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic to develop low-cost biosensing hardware and browser-based BCI applications.We built a considerable amount of open-source software, particularly the [Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com).

Following disputes between Garrett and Josh about proper professional conduct and a lack of alignment on future business decisions, **Brains@Play LLC was dissolved in September 2023.**

A few mistakes stood out as key contributors to the company's failure:
1. **Coupling our software roadmap to ambitious hardware goals** that ultimately were never realized.
2. **Focusing on developer tools** rather than our core product.
3. **Working diligently without a clear business model** and sustainable funding through contracts, grants, or community support.

A complete archive of our work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/brainsatplay) and a [full summary of our work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3594806.3594810) was published in August 2023 following Garrett's graduation from the MA in Media Arts, Games, and Health program.
