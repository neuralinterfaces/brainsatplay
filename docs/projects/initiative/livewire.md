## The Speakers
### Dong Song
[Dong Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-song-159aa221/) is a research associate professor of biomedical engineering and co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering at USC. His research interests include nonlinear dynamical modeling of the nervous system, hippocampal memory prosthesis, neural interface technologies, and development of novel modeling strategies incorporating both statistical and mechanistic methods. He invented the multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical model of spike transformation that serves as the computational basis of hippocampal memory prostheses.

### Eran Klein
[Eran Klein](https://phil.washington.edu/people/eran-klein) is a neurologist specializing in dementia at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and the Portland VA Medical Center. He is part of the neuroethics thrust at the NSF Center for Neurotechnology (CNT) at the University of Washington. He works at the intersection of neurology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

### Judy Illes
[Judy Illes](https://neurology.med.ubc.ca/faculty-listing/academic/judy-illes/) is a past president of the International Neuroethics Society and director of Neuroethics Canada at the University of British Columbia. A pioneer and eminent scholar in the field of neuroethics, she has made groundbreaking contributions to ethical, social, and policy challenges at the intersection of biomedical ethics and neuroscience, emerging neurotechnologies for neurologic and psychiatric conditions affecting people across the life span, decision-making, cross-cultural values, and the commercialization of healthcare.

### Joseph Artuso
[Joseph Artuso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-artuso-7b1b3b1/) is the president and chief commercial officer (CCO) of OpenBCI.
