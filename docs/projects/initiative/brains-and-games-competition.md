## The Highlights

1. **68 participants** from elementary schools to universities
2. **20 submissions** from seven different countries
3. **$14,000 USD in prizes** awarded to the twelve teams
4. **48 judges** with expertise in game design, neuroscience, and education


## Competition Details

The competition had three submission categories:
1. **Brain Games**: Open to any and all participants. Only creative ideas required!
2. **VR + Neurotech + Health**: Teams of 2-4 participants will conceptualize and design a future multiplayer game that uses brain-to-brain interaction (BBI) technologies. Prototype required for submission.
3. **Computational Art**: Individuals and groups will submit works of computational art that (1) explore themes surrounding neuroscience, ethics, technology, and consciousness, (2) respond to real-time data from 2+ brains, and (3) incorporate at least one other type of user interactivity (e.g. mouse movement, camera, etc). Prototype required for submission.

### Awards
The twelve (12) top teams were awarded:
1. At least one Muse 2 Headband and mentorship from Brains@Play to develop game prototypes during Summer 2021.
2. One 3-pack of Ready-Mades of The Brain Architecture Game (valued at $99 - available to ship only to US and Canadian addresses).
3. DIY license coupons for The Brain Architecture Game for each member of the submitting team (valued at $99 - available to anyone worldwide).
4. An annual pass to the Remote Teams Edition of The Brain Architecture Game for each member of the submitting team (valued at $99 - available to anyone worldwide).

### Grand Prize
One team from the VR + Neurotech + Health submission category will be awarded mentorship from Brains@Play and $5000 from the USC SMART-VR Center and Enosis to develop a functional demo of their game for Fall 2021.
